# Summary

When a planet orbiting a star outside of our solar system (known as an exoplanet) passes in front of its host star along our line of sight, it occults a fraction of the stellar light. This phenomenon is known as a transit. The *Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite* (TESS) is a NASA mission currently performing a nearly all-sky survey to search for transiting exoplanets [@ricker2015], which has already resulted in over 7,000 planet candidates and 600 confirmed planets[^1]. TESS observes the majority of stars in large 24x90 degree rectangular regions of the sky known as Full-Frame Images (FFIs). These FFIs were observed at a 30-minute cadence for the TESS prime mission, 10-minute cadence for the first extended mission, and 200-second cadence in the second extended mission. We present the `giants` pipeline, a Python package to analyze TESS FFI observations to search for planets transiting evolved (subgiant and red giant) stars.

# Statement of Need

As a host star evolves into a subgiant and then a red giant, it becomes cooler, larger, and more luminous. This stellar evolution has two primary effects on a planet's transit: the transit becomes shallower and lower signal to noise due to the increased brightness of the host star it is transiting, and the duration of the transit increases as the stellar radius grows larger. Additionally, evolved stars exhibit photometric variability due to surface granulation which can obscure a transit signal [@grunblatt2019]. 

Multiple large-scale transit-search efforts exist to identify new transiting planets in the TESS FFI observations, most prominently the MIT Quick-Look Pipeline (QLP; [@huang2020]) and NASA's Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC; [@jenkins2020]). These search efforts are intended to apply broadly to all transiting planet systems, in particular small planets around nearby main sequence stars to fulfill the TESS mission objectives. In order to recover transit signals around stars with a broad range of properties, these pipelines apply noise removal and flattening methods which often remove the shallow, long-duration transits around subgiants and red giant stars [@grunblatt2024]. Other widely-used TESS FFI pipelines, including Eleanor [@feinstein2019] and TGLC [@han2023], face similar difficulties recovering the low-SNR transits of evolved stars. Other pipelines, such as TASOC [@lund2021] and CDIPS [@bouma2019], were designed to provide light curves for the analysis of specific classes of host stars. However, no such pipeline for planets transiting giant stars exists in the community, presenting the need for the `giants` pipeline.

# Data Access

The `giants` pipeline uses TESS FFI data stored on the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) operated by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). There are two primary methods for downloading these data, described below.

## Cloud Data

The MAST archive hosts image cubes containing TESS FFI observations on a publicly accessible cloud server using S3 Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). The `giants` pipeline downloads pixel cutouts from these image cubes using the `from_cloud_data` method of the `giants.Target` object. Accessing cloud data utilizes the `astrocut`[^2] Python package produced by STScI. This is the default and recommended method. 

## `TESSCut`

To download FFI observations with `TESSCut`, a user may call the `giants.Target` method `from_lightkurve`. This will use the `lightkurve.search_tesscut` function, which queries available observations and downloads TESS FFI pixel cutouts with the Python implementation of the `TESSCut` tool[^3]. 

# Noise Removal

We utilize the `RegressionCorrector` module of Lightkurve to remove common sources of instrumental noise that inhibit transiting planet detection. The most significant contribution to the noise is produced by the light scattered onto the TESS detector by the Earth and Moon as TESS orbits, which manifests as highly periodic, high-amplitude spikes in the measured flux. For a small region of the detector (i.e. our 11x11 pixel cutouts), this signal is present in every pixel and broadly spatially uniform. 

To remove the scattered light background, we first define an aperture which captures the flux from the target star. By default, we use an aperture mask containing the central 3x3 pixels in the cutout (by setting the `aperture_mask` keyword to `'center'`); however, the aperture mask can also be set to `'threshold'` or `'pipeline'` following the functionality in `lightkurve`. We then create a design matrix of regressors, each containing the time-series flux of a single pixel outside of the target aperture, and perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the columns of the design matrix. We use PCA to reduce our design matrix to the five most significant signals shared among background pixels, which has proven effective at isolating the noise properties across the pixel cutout. The `RegressionCorrector` fits weights to the reduced design matrix to identify the contribution of the background regressors to the flux *within* the target aperture to construct a noise model, which is subtracted from the target flux, leaving the desired signal intact. This approach is similar to the Pixel-Level De-correlation technique used successfully for observations by the *Spitzer* space telescope [@deming] and *Kepler*'s follow-up *K2* mission [@luger].

After removing the most significant noise signal with our PCA-derived model, we remove long-term trends that remain in the light curve due to astrophysical signals such as stellar variability (from the target or a background source). We apply the `flatten` method of `lightkurve`, which utilizes a Savitzky-Golay filter. We set the window length of the filter to be much longer than the expected duration of any planet transits (~10 days) to avoid the possibility of erroneously flattening the planet signal. We then median-normalize the flux in the light curve.

The noise removal approach is applied to each sector individually, as the new detector orientations require unique de-trending models. The corrected and normalized light curves are stitched together before performing our planet search.

# Transiting Planet Search

We search for transiting planet signals using the `astropy` implementation of the `BoxLeastSquares` (BLS) algorithm. We first bin the data to 30-minute cadence for uniformity, and search over a grid of 5,000 periods evenly spaced between 2 and 30 days and 1,000 durations evenly spaced between 0.1 and 1.0 days. We identify the period, duration, and transit epoch with the highest BLS power and compute the best-fitting depth of a box model, providing an estimate for the radius of the transiting object. 

# Summary Plots

For each target, we produce a summary plot which contains information necessary to perform by-eye vetting. An example is shown in Figure \ref{fig:summary}. 

![Summary plot for TIC 139474683 produced by the `giants` pipeline.\label{fig:summary}](paper_fig1.png)

The summary plot displays the full, corrected light curve produced by our pipeline in the top panel, with each identified potential transit signal marked by a red arrow. Using the best-fitting period and transit epoch, we fold the light curve, isolating the alternating even and odd transits to check for differences in depth (a common diagnostic for false positives due to eclipsing binary stars). The bottom left panel shows the full phase-folded light curve with the best-fitting BLS model, and the residuals between the data and the model.

We additionally display an image of the pixel cutout with the aperture mask highlighted and mark the stars in the field with their *Gaia* DR2 positions, scaling the points based on their *Gaia*-band magnitudes [@gaia]. The bottom right panel shows an image subtraction between the median in-transit cadences and out-of-transit cadences, highlighting the change in flux per pixel during transit.

# Running `giants` on Custom Light Curves

The planet search functionality of `giants` can also be run on light curves produced by other *TESS* pipelines. The `plot_summary` function of `giants` can take `custom_lc` and `custom_id` arguments, which will be searched for transiting signals with BLS and a summary plot will be generated. This can be applied to light curves produced by any other TESS FFI pipeline or custom de-trending when the data are provided as a `lightkurve.LightCurve` object.

# Applications

The `giants` pipeline has been used in the detection and validation of numerous planets across 7 papers [@saunders2022,@grunblatt2022,@grunblatt2023,@grunblatt2024,@periera2024,@saunders2024,@saunders2025].
